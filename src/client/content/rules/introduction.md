This is a catch all for all of the notes before we finish building and organizing the system.

What if we built a system more based on customization and choice?

What is our random number generator engine?
- d10
- d20
- d%

What grants a player choice?
- Multi-classing
- Feats
- Skill Variance
  - Different abilities for different spells and skills
- Giving different vocations different abilities
  - Knights shouldn't have all breaks

How do we achieve multi-classing?
- Classes & Jobs
- Take X levels in class 1 & Y levels in class 2 and unlock Job
- Jobs grant abilities based on how much of the underlying classes you have leveled
- Jobs allow you to use abilities up to a certain point in your classes
- You can have one Class or Job "active" at a time
- You can have one Support ability from any class or job you have leveled
- You can have one Reaction ability from any class or job you have leveled

Magic
- Design Level 3/4 of skills first, push silliness, make lower levels lesser effects
- Magic Die is simply d10, more or less MP
- Spells Cost half a Magic Die per Spell Level (6 right now)
- Given Fire deals 1x Damage, Fire II will deal 2x damage and cost 3x what Fire I costs
- AoE for Spells will be limited to certain levels of spells
  - Do we want to limit to only pure casters can alter spell AoE?
  - I.E. Dark Knight casting Darkness or Fire cannot make it AoE
  - Aero III or IV cannot be cast single target or it loses potency casting in a smaller AoE
  - Fire IV AoE is so large that it will hit the caster unless they cast it at max range
- Spells need a charge time
- Black Magic -> Fire, Ice, Thunder, Darkness
- White Magic -> Air, Earth, Water, Holy
- Time Magic -> Arcane, Time, Space
