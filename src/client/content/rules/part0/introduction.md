Welcome to Final Fantasy Role Playing Game 3.50.

## Worlds of Final Fantasy

Talk about the multiverse of Final Fantasy (maybe lift from current book).

### The Wonders of Magic

### The Marvels of Technology

## Using This Book

Part 1 - Building a Character  
Part 2 - Playing the Game  
Part 3 - Magic and Spellcasting  
Part 4 - For the Game Master  
Part 5 - Appendix  

## How to Play

Play is done as a conversation between the players and the game master. Scenes are held in which the game master will describe the scene and the players will use their attributes, skills, abilites, spells, equipment and anything else they have to try and take the scene in the direction they want to go.

### Game Dice

This game uses mutliple types of dice. They are referenced with the letter `d` followed by the number of sides they have. What people are most familiar with are the six-sided dice used in games like Monopoly; this would be refered to as a d6.

You will need mutliple of each of these types of dice: d6, d8, d10, and d12.

### The D100

The most important dice in the game is actual a pair of d10 called a d100 (or dpercentile or d%). When rolling a d10, designate one die as the tens value, and roll the pair. The results are 1 - 100, where 100 is represented by both dice showing `0` as there values (I remember this by thinking that the only number in 1 - 100 that has two `0`'s is 100).

### Chance of Success

Whenever you take on a task that has a random outcome, you will roll the d100 and try to roll below a threshold called a Chance of Success (CoS). A CoS is determined by what task you are trying to accomplish, what modifiers are applied by the situation and the characters involved, and other factors taken into account by the game master. A task with a 0 CoS is impossible; it simply cannot be done. A task with a 100+ CoS is trivial and no roll is needed.

#### Botch and Critical Success

The last concepts around CoS are Botches and Critical Successes (Crits). A task is automatically failed on a roll of 96 - 100. This usually plays out as some minute detail being missed that leads to things going horribly awry, such as activating a trap instead of disarming it.

A task is automatically successful if the roll is a result of 1 - 10. In combat this results in a Critical Hit, signifying finding a weak point in the enemies defenses and connecting a decisive blow. In non-combat scenarios, this represents a deft application of skill seeming to defy reality.

With regards to critical successes, if a task has a CoS of 10 or less, it is normally ruled as a skin of the teeth miracle rather than a rousing success. If the CoS is lowered to less than 0 by modifiers, but the player still rolls a Crit it could negate the fall out of taking such an action or at the game master's discresion, even move things more in the party's favor.

## Game Play Notes

I would recommend leveraging Roll20 with the built in character sheet for FFRPG3, otherwise this system can be cumbersome to track and run. While it only has a character sheet and monster sheet, this does a lot to make the game playable.
