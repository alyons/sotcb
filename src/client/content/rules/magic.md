- Design Level 3/4 of skills first, push silliness, make lower levels lesser effects
- Magic Die is simply d10, more or less MP
- Spells Cost half a Magic Die per Spell Level (6 right now)
- Given Fire deals 1x Damage, Fire II will deal 2x damage and cost 3x what Fire I costs
- AoE for Spells will be limited to certain levels of spells
  - Do we want to limit to only pure casters can alter spell AoE?
  - I.E. Dark Knight casting Darkness or Fire cannot make it AoE
  - Aero III or IV cannot be cast single target or it loses potency casting in a smaller AoE
  - Fire IV AoE is so large that it will hit the caster unless they cast it at max range
- Spells need a charge time
- Black Magic -> Fire, Ice, Thunder, Darkness
- White Magic -> Air, Earth, Water, Holy
- Time Magic -> Arcane, Time, Space
