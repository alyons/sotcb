but most characters can fit into one of those archetypes. These classes and 
jobs might not capture every unique aspect of each of the characters found in 
Final Fantasy, but seeks more to approximate the games and ideas set forth in 
more Ivalice inspired worlds, while still integrating aspects from all over
