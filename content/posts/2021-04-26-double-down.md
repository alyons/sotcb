While this may sound like a step backwards, this is really more related to 
the fact that in tooling around with FFRPG 3rd, my friends and I found a lot 
more that could be improved or tweaked on. What we came to understand is to 
grant the agency we wanted in player choice in build, we would have to truly 
rework the class system, and while we were at it, we might as well rework how 
leveling works and then how stats work and we should touch up weapons to make 
them more unique in choosing between them, so we just really reached the most 
sensible conclusion.

## What does that mean for v3.5?

Well, we are definitely not going to re-tool that system. I do think it could 
get that kind of TLC and become even better, but to accomplish our goal, we 
need to focus on this system and make sure we have all of our ducks in a row.

## How are you going to build this out?

Using Final Fantasy I! I am actually serious. As most of you are probably 
familiar with the fact that Final Fantasy is really Dungeons and Dragons 
on a video game console: the first version of the game has spell slots! My 
goal is to make sure that we have a playable version at each iteration, 
creating a campaign along side of our improvements and changes, this way 
we can validate the system functions while we are building, rather than 
reaching some arbitrary point and realizing stats don't work how we need them 
to.

### Current Plan

- [ ] 0.1 - A Journey Begins with a Single Step
  - Have four characters to create a party
  - Have a single enemy (Goblin) and single boss (Garland) for the party to fight
  - Have a simple campaign allowing the party to participate in combat
  - Have the rules for combat ready for this simple system
