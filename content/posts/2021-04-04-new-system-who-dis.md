# Final Fantasy RPG - Shards of the Crystal Braves

What was supposed to be a rework of FFRPG 3rd has branched off into a complete rework of the FFRPG system. While we are not very far into development, we do have some ideas of what to do to improve the game. We will also be keeping notes here for our own use and perhaps will make both 3.5 and 5 to see how things pan out.

## What is Final Fantasy RPG 3rd?

A wonderful table top game which can be found [here][ffrpg-site]. The Final Fantasy RPG system aims to recreate the magic of the Final Fantasy games in table top form; being flexible enough to represent any game in the series, while still having all of the various iconic themes and things from Final Fantasy.

## What was wrong with the system?

Honestly, not much! It's just that in years of playing other TTRPGs, I have learned a lot and think the system could be improved. Currently, the best way to play is on [Roll20][roll20-site] using the included [character sheet][ffrpg-char-sheet].

That being said, there are definitely some better writing techniques and better balancing and choice that could be added to the game, granting players better clarity into what is happening and making it easier to understand the game as a whole. Also, non-caster classes leave a lot to be desired.

This spawned a conversation with a friend of mine, and he pointed out how much the system could be changed to give players agency in creating their characters; the current FFRPG 3rd doesn't allow for multi-classing and we realized we could leverage that idea to create a system which allow a character to be created from multiple pieces to make a fully realized character.

## Okay, then what would change in each version?

### Final Fantasy RPG 3.5
- Better website for easier time navigating and finding information.
- Update the wording to be more clear for certain sections.
- Reworks to most non-Mage classes
- Create Support and Reaction Abilities for each class
- Rework Skill System to make it easier to keep track of points and the like
- Integrate Hit Dice and Magic Dice as part of resting
- Integrate the Battle Grid as default rules with slight tweak
- Monster Maker Website with Bestiary

### Final Fantasy RPG 5
- Basis of System is Choices
  - 12 Basic Classes that combine into ?? Advanced Jobs
  - Offensive Magic will have additional effects
- Continue and expand on many of the ideas above
