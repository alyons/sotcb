# Final Fantasy 3.25

- [ ] Updated website to be easier to read
  - Make a modern version of the website

  - Update terminology used with `Learned` skills, as this trips up players

  - M.Acc Formula: `MAG * 2 + Job Acc + Wpn Skill`
  - M.Eva Formula: `AGI + SPR`
- [ ] Skill Rework
  - Do we bother?
  - How to lessen the points to distribute
    - Currently, players are given 400+ skill points to distribute
    - Limit skill points by 1/5
    - Skill Cap is 10 + 1/4 Level
    - Skill Rating = Skill Points * 5

    - Everyone speaks Common
    - Racial/Background Languages +1 each
    - Humes get +1 of choice

- [ ] Job Reworks
  - Only update jobs players want to use (Black Mage, Dark Knight, Engineer, Monk, White Caller)
  - Give each job a reaction
  - Give each job a support ability
    - Inate Magic Atk Up for Black Mages
    - Inate Teleport for Time Mages
    - Inate Ignore Height for Dragoons
  - Make sure jobes get more skills as they level (e.g. Monk gets 11~ abilities where Black Mage gets 34)
  - Abilities & Actions shouldn't auto hit, and in fact need detriments to basic attacks
