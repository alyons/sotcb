# Classes and Jobs

## Classes

Classes are the basis for your character. You can level as many classes as you want. Each time you gain a level, you can take either a new class or an additional level in a class you already have. There are three types of classes and four classes within each type.

Martial Classes are classes that specialize in the use of weapons and physical prowess.

Technical Classes are classes that specialize in the use of skills.

Magical Classes are classes that specialize in utilizing mana and casting spells.

Adept Classes are specialized classes that have a specific skill set that do not lead into other jobs.
